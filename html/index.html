						<h4>We need you!</h4>
						<p>
							<strong>We need you as a user:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							As a user you can <a href="/bin/index.cgi">search for packages</a>, download and
							install them. If you have made some experiences with the packages, you can comment on them
							and rate them. This helps other users to find the best packages.
						</p>
						<p>
							A site like OPAR lives with its users, so we welcome every new user!
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>We need you as a developer:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							OPAR was inspired by the great <a href="http://search.cpan.org">CPAN</a> -- the repository for
							Perl libraries. We hope that OPAR becomes such a great success as CPAN and that developers
							publish their OTRS packages.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have written an OTRS package that can be published under some Open Source Licenses,
							please create an OPM file and upload it to OPAR.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>We need you for more general tasks</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							We want to create a great FAQ to help people to work with OTRS and OPAR. How to
							create an OPM file? How can I integrate OPAR in my OTRS? If you have any questions,
							please <a href="/bin/index.cgi/feedback">contact us</a>.
						</p>

						<h4>OTRS</h4>
						<p>
						<a href="http://www.otrs.org">OTRS</a> has all the necessary features to manage customer 
						requests per telephone, e-mails, fax and pretty much any of todays methods of communication.
						The application is built for and around service inquiries. It does not matter if you run a 
						world wide follow the sun service desk, a computer emergency response team (CERT), a member 
						management system for your local community organization or a pizza delivery service, if you 
						have customers to take care of OTRS can do the job.
						</p>
						<p>
						Do you receive many e-mails, phone calls and or faxes and want to answer them uniformly 
						and structured? You're going to love the OTRS!
						</p>
						<p>
						Requests, taken care of primarily per an intuitive user interface within your browser, can 
						be handled by multiple or even just one agent. Customers can choose the channel of 
						communication best fitting their needs. From a smart phone friendly web interface, to rich 
						text (HTML) emails, every means leads to the same end. And updates are just as simple. 
						Follow-ups can be transmitted in any form as well. As long as the ticket number is found in 
						the correspondence. The ticket number can be (normally) in the subject, the body or an 
						attachment within the mail. Even the message id will be used to make sure that the efforts 
						are not being doubled.
						</p>
						<p>
						Using our smart packaging tool, OPM - OTRS package manager, extensions can be built by any 
						developer, packaged and passed on to other users. Through packaging of own changes to the 
						system, the system is then more audit proof. Additionally, the package system backs up all 
						files changed, to make sure that an uninstall is successful.
						</p>
						<h4>Perl</h4>
						<p>
						    <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>
						    is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text 
						    files, and printing reports based on that information. Itâ€™s also a good language for many system management 
						    tasks. The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful 
						    (tiny, elegant, minimal).
						</p>
						<p>
						    <strong>Perl strengths</strong><br />
						    <ul>
						        <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org">CPAN</a> - the worlds largest single-namespace software repository.</li>
							<li>A strong culture for software testing, with more than 370 testing modules
							    and almost every CPAN package coming with tests.</li>
							<li>CPAN Testers - a volunteer community that tests all software uploaded to 
							    CPAN on all kinds of OSes and Perl versions, and uploading the results to 
							    a central repository.</li>
							<li>Vibrant grass-roots communitis all over the globe, refreshingly untainted 
							    by corporate tools. Find your local Perl Mongers group! :)</li>
						        <li>Active support communities at PerlMonks and on irc.perl.org.</li>
							<li>Conferences all over the planet. Most of them are low-key and informal,
							    and all of them have a high signal/noise ratio.</li>
							<li>Active blogging and scenes, with the 
							    <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org">Perl Iron Man competition</a>,
							    <a href="http://blogs.perl.org">blogs.perl.org</a>, 
							    <a href="http://perl-nachrichten.de">Perl-Nachrichten.de</a> as highlights.</li>
